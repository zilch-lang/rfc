# RFC description

<!-- Informally and shortly describe what your RFC is all about. A few lines should be enough as the RFC will be described more in depth. -->

# Motivation for this RFC

<!-- Your RFC should be backed up with arguments as to why it should be considered and accepted. -->

# In depth description (formalisation)

<!-- Describe your RFC formally.
  - Grammar changes must be accompanied with a BNF-like text to describe it.
    You may additionnaly use the library <https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams> as is done in <https://github.com/zilch-lang/specification/blob/master/railroad-diagrams.py#L1>.
    Various styles are applied depending on the language concerned.
  - Type checking must at least be deeply described so as to be as clear as possible.
    You may as well write type inference rules, but this is not required.
  - A change to the standard library must contain precise locations in the source code where changes are to be expected, with a small description of each change.

# Evaluated changes to the codebase

<!-- Ultimately, if your RFC is accepted, then changes to the codebase will most likely be required. As such, we require RFC author to evaluate changes to the codebase (it may be informally, e.g. "The parser should accept the following grammar ...").  -->

## Grammar

<!-- If your grammar is described using railroad diagrams, please uncomment this ans put the code in it:
